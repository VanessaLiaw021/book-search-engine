## Description 

This is a search book engine. This was a refactoring assignment, where I refactor this web application to meet the GraphQL requirement and/or standards. This web application allow a user to search for a book and saved that book to the saved pages. User is can only interact with the web application when they either login or sign up. 

## Visuals
